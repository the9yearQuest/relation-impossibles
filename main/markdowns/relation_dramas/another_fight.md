what went down that day? what was said? what is wrong here? how I can fix this broken relation? can it really be fixed?
why i feel so tired of all this? do I have the energy or a hope to keep the fight? the effort. why do I feel so unhappy? isn't it the sign of failure? 
what do I expect from her? is there a chance that she change? is there a chance that we get to the same page?


- I don't have the knowleghe to read minds to know what you consider "the point" of the story. (annoyed and sarcastic tone)
- oh yeah?! okay, anything else? -No - okay Bye

-  Are you okay? has your blood suger dropped? are you scared? -no, .., I know you are scared. a man that is not scared of some minor diabetes, ...
-  no I am okay - no I know you are not, some thing is defenitely off about you, you were not okay this morning from the begining.
-  I am okay, I told you, it was not any big deal, I was just a bit nervous this morning,I am okay. I don't care about this diabetes. I am fine. 
-  okay, fine, anything else? -No -bye

(calling again after few minutes)
...
- I have been feeling bad  just a couple of days for my period and here you have gone impatient about it! 
-  no this is not true, this has nothing to do with your period. I was so worried and upset about your pain,
-  yeah you were really worried that you slept so comfortably the one time I needed you and did answer my call.
- I  can't have ontrol really when to sleep and when to wake up.

- I know you were angry about something from the begining, you were so ...
- my being upset does not have to do with all this fake reasons you are making up. 
- you can't really see that what you said made me upset? 
- When I am giving you some information, if you don't like what I say, the social norm says that you 
wouldn't scold me for not saying what you want, you would just never mind and move on!
- Oh you are teaching me about social norms ??!! (angry) (contintuing screaming)
- IF YOU CARE SO MUCH ABOUT SOCIAL NORMs, WHY  WON'T  you look yourself at "other men" and how the men treat their women?!! 
how they truely love their girls and how they do anything for their girls? 
how much girls show attitude to them and their men don't even mind any attitudes from them.
( This is a truely bothering words she has repeated so many times in the past)
- NO NOT AT ALL! (Angry and Yelling!)
- NEVER ITS LIKE THAT, AND EVEN IF IT WAS I DON'T CARE ABOUT OTHER MEN, I am NOT ONE OF THOSE MEN ...
[I've told you before that I don't accept insults & attitudes.] (it is poosible that I didn't get to actually say this)
- ( angry and screaming) IF YOUR ARE NOT ONE OF THOSE MEN, THEN WHY DON"T YOU GET THE HELL OUT OF MY LIFE THAT YOU HAVE MADE IT SO MISERABLE.
(hanging up)

(me calling right after..)

(with an angry and low voice) you know what, I will get the hell out of your life, and you never call me anymore please! (hanging up)

(continum of angry calls and insults and ..)

(can't recall really what was said after this point, some that comes to me with no order)
- you desrve a gril like that bitch who played his husband to the point she got her green card and then lift him high and dry and 
left nothing out of his life with no remorse.

- you desrve one of those mexican girls who are always happy and dance and got nothing else.
