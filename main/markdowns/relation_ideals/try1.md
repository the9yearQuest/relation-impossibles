so what do I want to say here?

well typing with this seems very hard.

I think when I started this, I was thinking more about a serious deal! 
On discovering what I really am looking for in this, what should I be expecting
What are my perspective of an ideal relationship. 
Or what I call sometime a partnership. 
What are the fundamentals and what are the constitution for a relationship.

but also i guess I had some fantasy some imagination of a ideal relation! A story of the super girlfriend!
the perfect girlfriend! How would it be?!
