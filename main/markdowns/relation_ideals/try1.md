so what do I want to say here?

well typing with this seems very hard.

I think when I started this, I was thinking more about a serious deal! 
On discovering what I really am looking for in this, what should I be expecting
What are my perspective of an ideal relationship. 
Or what I call sometime a partnership. 
What are the fundamentals and what are the constitution for a relationship.

but also i guess I had some fantasy some imagination of an ideal relation! A story of the super girlfriend!
the perfect girlfriend! How would it be?! maybe would be more of a comedy.

the other thing was about the story of Dr. Dark Angel.  I wanted it to be separate.
both of them are ideas that intrigues me and i like to commit to them.
but at the same time I see that one may not carry too many big stones.
I am already thinking about it here and there, bits and pieaes, maybe it is just collecting those.
and maybe that is just the big job that will not finish
