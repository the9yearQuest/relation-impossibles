so what do I want to say here?

well typing with this seems very hard.

I think when I started this, I was thinking more about a serious deal! 
On discovering what I really am looking for in this, what should I be expecting
What are my perspective of an ideal relationship. 
Or what I call sometime a partnership. 
What are the fundamentals and what are the constitution for a relationship.

but also i guess I had some fantasy some imagination of an ideal relation! A story of the super girlfriend!
the perfect girlfriend! How would it be?! maybe would be more of a comedy.

the other thing was about the story of Dr. Dark Angel.  I wanted it to be separate.
both of them are ideas that intrigues me and i like to commit to them.
but at the same time I see that one may not carry too many big stones.
I am already thinking about it here and there, bits and pieaes, maybe it is just collecting those.
and maybe that is just the big job that will not finish


OK hell right so what do I got about relationship i want to think about what I want what I don't want today I'm not in the mood to think about the story or anything but i just need to start from somewhere I guess part of the reason that I have so much back-and-forth and coral wait tina is that I don't have clear boundaries on what I don't want although I have made myself very clear on the level of insults i think he's not acceptable should I review it myself what happened
